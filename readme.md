# Bitcoin Miner

This is a simple implementation of the bitcoin mining protocol in Java. It leverages multi-threading for increased performance.
That being said this in no way should be used to actually attempt to min bitcoins. This code is ment to be simple to read
and understand rather than being highly performant.

This code was written in part by following this blog post 
[Bitcoin mining the hard way](http://www.righto.com/2014/02/bitcoin-mining-hard-way-algorithms.html)
which gives a detailed overview of the bitcoin mining protocol.
